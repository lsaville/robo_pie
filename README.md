####What It Is
A web application where robots can go to order delicious pizzas with custom toppings! 
Visitors can add pies to their cart from the menu, in the cart they can edit the quantity of an item they order and all purchase totals will auto-update.
Visitors can then login or signup and their orders will persist in their cart.  Once logged in they can place their order, edit their contact/delivery information, and view their order history.

Admins can view all orders.  Admins can mark an order as 'Ordered', 'Paid', 'Cancelled', and 'Completed' and then filter all orders by their status.  They can also edit the name, description, image, and price of items available in the store and set items to active and inactive.
